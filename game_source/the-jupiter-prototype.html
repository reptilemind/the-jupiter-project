This is the place where rabbits go.  I&#39;ve been here before.  We never speak to each other, but we are |aware&gt;[aware] of each other.  We are old sentinals of this place.

I will always be here unless I leave.  I can go any time I want.  Tunnels go off every direction but up.

I can [[sniffle into one of the many tunnels-&gt;The Warren]] or [[climb onto a tree root, to get to one of the larger, upper ones-&gt;Upper Warren]]

There are a few things here.  One of them is a pair of pairs of Moon Shoes, rabbit, sized.  If you want to, you can |shoe&gt;[put the Moon Shoes on].

I guess that&#39;s all the things there are, really.

There&#39;s also a book you can |book&gt;[read the text of].
